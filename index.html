      <h2>About Aaron</h2>
      <p>After working at unfulfilling jobs I decided to become a certified personal trainer. Although I loved working with clients, I found that I was not interested in sales. Therefore, I decided to rekindle my passion for coding and become a developer.</p>
      <p>As a student at <a href="www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>I am on my journey to becoming a web developer and couldn't be happier!</p>
      <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer or work together on a project please reach out! I love practicing my skills and working with others.</p>
